# Knight Titles

This is the public repo for my Crusader Kings III addon - Knight Titles

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2342632546

Newly updated to work with the latest version, 1.8.2!

NOTE: Due to limitations in how Paradox allows titles to be implemented, you will have to wait up to 3 months after a knight is hired for the title to be applied to them.

A mod to give the title of "Sir" to Anglo-Saxon Knights, as they would have been historically given.
English & Scottish Knights also now take the title of "Sir"
Knights of an Italian & Iberian culture now take the title of "Don"
Knights of a German or Norse culture now take the title of "Herr"
Knights of a Frankish culture now take the title of "Sire"
Knights of a West Slavic culture now take the title of "Pan"

A big thanks to the CK3 Mod Coop Discord for help in putting together and debugging the original version of the mod.

A huge thanks to Leprzilla in bringing the mod up to date with the latest game version and the new culture system.
